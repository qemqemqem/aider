# Aider - Enhanced Fork

This project is a fork of [aider.chat](https://aider.chat/), an AI pair programming tool that lets you collaborate with GPT to edit code in your local Git repository.

## New Features

This enhanced fork includes all the original aider functionality plus two new commands:

- `/focus`: Helps you concentrate on specific parts of your codebase during a session
- `/document`: Automatically generates or improves documentation for your code

## Getting Started

See the original documentation at [aider.chat](https://aider.chat/) for installation and basic usage instructions.

## Using the New Commands

### Focus Command

The `/focus` command allows you to direct the AI's attention to specific files or code sections:

```
/focus path/to/file.py
```

### Document Command

The `/document` command helps you generate or improve documentation:

```
/document path/to/file.py
```
