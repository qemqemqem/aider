# Implement Natural Language Parsing for Git Commands

## Description

Develop a system that can interpret natural language requests related to git operations, particularly focusing on backtracking and reverting changes. This will allow users to use phrases like "go back to before we started using X" without needing to know specific git commands.

## Checklist

- [ ] Identify common phrases and patterns users might use to request backtracking
- [ ] Create a mapping between natural language patterns and git operations
- [ ] Implement context-aware parsing to understand what features or changes the user is referring to
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogues for potentially destructive operations
- [ ] Develop fallback mechanisms when the intent is unclear
- [ ] Create helpful responses that explain what actions were taken
