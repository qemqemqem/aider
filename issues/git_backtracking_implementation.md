# Implement Git Backtracking Functionality

## Description

Implement the core functionality that allows aider to backtrack through git history based on natural language requests from users. This will enable users to say things like "this isn't working, go back to before we started trying to use foobar" and have aider understand and execute the appropriate git operations.

## Checklist

- [ ] Enhance the GitRepo class to support more sophisticated history navigation
- [ ] Implement functionality to identify commits related to specific features or approaches
- [ ] Create a mechanism to analyze commit messages and code changes to understand what was being attempted
- [ ] Develop a safe way to revert to previous states without losing history
- [ ] Add support for natural language parsing of backtracking requests
- [ ] Integrate with the existing undo functionality
