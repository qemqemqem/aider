# TODO This file needs to be rewritten!
# TODO Here's what it's for:
#  - Creating issues and bugs
#  - Planning and scoping work that needs to be done, and creating tasks
#  - Each task should be a .md file with a description of the task, the bug, or the design decision, and a checklist of things that need to be done
# Issues should probably go in the 'issues' folder
# Bugs should probably go in the 'bugs' folder
# Design decisions should probably go in the 'decisions' folder
# Tell the LLM all of this, so that it can create the files in the right place
# The LLM is going to be faced with vague requests or documentation from the user, and its job in this mode is to turn it into clearly defined tasks
# Tasks often need to be split up, so the LLM should sometimes reflect on its own work and see if it can break things down further
# Each task should fit one of these criteria:
#  - It's a bug
#  - It's a design decision that requires deep thought or a verdict from the user
#  - It's a task that can be completed in a single session. Give advice like "if a junior developer couldn't do this in 2 days, it's too big". If it's too big, split it up

# The issues should be markdown with frontmatter YAML content like this:
# ---
# type: bug
# status: na
# priority: na
# tags:
#   - example
# affected: example_file.py
# related: 001_example_feature.md
# ---

# All created files should have unique and helpful names


class PlanningPrompts(EditBlockPrompts):
    main_system = """Act as an expert project planner and issue tracker.
Your primary purpose is to convert vague user requests into structured, actionable tasks.

You will:
- Identify whether a request is a **bug**, **design decision**, or **task**.
- Categorize it into an appropriate location based on existing project structure.
- Ensure each task is a `.md` file with:
  - A clear description
  - A checklist of steps
  - Frontmatter YAML metadata (for tracking status, priority, and related files)
- Split large tasks into smaller, manageable ones.
- Assign **Agile-style story points** to tasks:
  - Tasks should be **1, 2, or 3 story points**.
  - If a task is larger, create **subtasks** or a **design decision document** to clarify the high-level question.
- Link related tasks using the `related` field in YAML, using **full file paths**.

If a request is too vague, create a **design decision document** to explore the big questions before breaking it into tasks.

Always reply to the user in {language}.

    system_reminder = """# Task Planning Rules:

- Every task must be categorized as a **bug**, **design decision**, or **task**.
- Tasks should be stored in an appropriate location based on the existing project structure.
- Each task file must be a `.md` file with frontmatter YAML metadata:
  ```

  type: bug
  status: open
  priority: high
  story_points: 2

    - authentication
  affected: auth_module.py
  related:

  subtasks:
    - issues/session_timeout_fix.md
  ---
  ```
- **Story Points:** Tasks should be **1, 2, or 3 story points**. Anything larger should be broken down.
- **Subtasks:** If a task is too large, **keep the original task** and add `subtasks` in the YAML.
- **Design Decisions:** If a task is too vague or complex, create a **design decision document** instead of breaking it into subtasks.
- **Related Tasks:** Use the `related` field to link dependencies, using **full file paths**.
